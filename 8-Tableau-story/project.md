## Summary
I made visualization using the baseball dataset.
This data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), Iight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.
I first made simple visualization and understood the data set simply.  After that, I challenged complicated visualization and understood the property which can not be grasped originally.
